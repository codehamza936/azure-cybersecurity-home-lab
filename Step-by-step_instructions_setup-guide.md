# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Honeypot Project on Azure

This project demonstrates how I built a cloud-based honeypot, simulated brute force attacks, and monitored them using Microsoft Sentinel.

---

## 🧩 Part 1: Setting Up My Azure Subscription

- Created a **Microsoft Azure** subscription.
- Logged into the Azure portal: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)

---

## 🛠️ Part 2: Creating the Honeypot (Virtual Machine)

- Launched a **Windows 10 Virtual Machine** in Azure.
- Selected a **lightweight VM size** to optimize for cost.
- **Saved** the VM’s **username and password** for future login attempts.

### 🔒 Network Security Group Configuration:

- Created an **Inbound Rule**:
  - **Allowed all incoming traffic** (intentionally exposing the VM to threats).

### 🔧 Inside the VM:

- **Logged in to the VM**
- **Disabled Windows Defender Firewall**:
  - `Start` → `Run` → `wf.msc`
  - Disabled all profiles: **Domain**, **Private**, and **Public**

## 🔍 Part 3: Simulating Attacks & Inspecting Logs

- Simulated **3 failed login attempts** as a fake user (e.g., `employee`)
- Successfully logged in afterward
- Opened **Event Viewer** → `Windows Logs` → `Security`
- Found **Event ID 4625** indicating failed login attempts

✅ Confirmed that real-time audit logging was functional.

## 📊 Part 4: Forwarding Logs to Sentinel + Using KQL

1. **Created a Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)**
2. **Provisioned Microsoft Sentinel** connected to that LAW
3. **Enabled Windows Security Events** using the AMA connector
4. **Created a Data Collection Rule (DCR)** to collect Windows logs

### 🔎 Verified with KQL:

```kql


## 🌍 Part 5: Log Enrichment with GeoIP Data

### 🔎 Problem:
Security logs only showed **IP addresses**, but lacked **geolocation data**.

### ✅ Solution:
- Downloaded a **GeoIP summarized CSV**
- In **Microsoft Sentinel → Watchlist**, created:

  | Field         | Value         |
  |---------------|---------------|
  | Name          | `geoip`       |
  | Source Type   | Local File    |
  | Search Key    | `network`     |
  | Rows Loaded   | ~55,000       |

### 🧠 Used KQL to Join Security Logs with GeoIP:

```kql
let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");
let WindowsEvents = SecurityEvent
| where IpAddress == ""
| where EventID == 4625
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, IpAddress, network);
WindowsEvents


🌐 Part 6: Creating an Interactive Global Attack Map
Opened Microsoft Sentinel → Workbooks

Created a new workbook

Deleted all default visuals

Added a new Query Element

Opened the Advanced Editor

Pasted JSON code from map.json

Visualized global attack sources using enriched IP geolocation data
